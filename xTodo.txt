Username
  Login
    I am 610
    
I signup with 610
  I get a text message saying iusername_confirmation = 4444 (I am 610)
  Go to app, type in 4444, it responds  with a protected hash that I store locally(I am 610)
  That app, with the hash, will now have access to all resources
  
  If you change username numbers, you will get a new confirmation
